## API calls

- Connect swipe with behavior
    - update Transaction

- Separate network vs local tests

✅ filter transactions where status is UNCLEARED
     ✅ Move Transaction into its own file

✅ Move NetworkInterface into its own file

✅ Wrap NetworkInterface in Result
     ✅ create type to hold Reponse (NetworkInterface.Response)

✅ inject good or bad key


✅ if 401 status, data.isEmpty? NO
	 ✅ assert contains "name: Error"

✅ assert status 200
	 ✅ handle optional URLSession

## Housekeeping
✅ remove example-transactions from git history
✅ change bearer token


## ✅ Rough Draft
	 ✅ rough draft UI
	✅ talk to API
		✅ bearer token

## Ideas for later

- Add Transaction.account_display_name
    - why? to help the user understand where the expense landed and to help them decide faster
- Activity Log
    - example: 5 transactions checked on Wednesday, 2 transactions checked on Tuesday
- Read Plaid metadata
    - why? PayPal strings are in there, not in the payee or original_name
